Hi Martin,

I wanted to provide you with an update on the Origo issue and the UAT environment situation. Here are the key points:

1. We have received confirmation from the Origo team that they are actively working on the fix for the issue we reported. However, they have not yet provided us with a confirmed ETA for when the fix will be completed.

2. The Camunda team has confirmed that the fix will be relatively quick to implement. However, they have mentioned that the same issue cannot be replicated in the UAT environment.

3. According to the Origo team, the UAT environment is currently undergoing their Pensions V5 release, which is why we cannot test the fix there. They have suggested testing the fix in another environment, specifically in Beta 01.

Martin, could you please confirm whether we have an environment set up for Origo's Beta 01? This will allow us to proceed with testing the fix in a suitable environment while the UAT environment is undergoing their release.

Your prompt response would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
