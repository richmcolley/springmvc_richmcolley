Subject: Alternate Share Class Service Issue - Urgent Attention Required

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to bring to your attention an issue we have identified with the Alternate Share Class Service that requires urgent action.

As you may be aware, the Alternate Share Class Service is a critical component of our operations, facilitating the identification and conversion of funds through alternate share classes. However, in recent cases, we have observed a concerning behavior where the service is not returning any fund for conversion. Consequently, our Business Process Management (BPM) system has been placing these deals on the primary fund as part of our business-as-usual (BAU) process.

Upon investigation, we have determined that the Alternate Share Class Service fetches its data from the daily caching maintained by our Asset Service. This daily caching process is distributed across multiple nodes to ensure redundancy and efficiency. Unfortunately, we have discovered that on certain days, this caching process did not occur as expected on a few nodes, leading to the service's inability to return the conversion fund.

It is important to note that there were no reported failures from the service itself during these incidents, which is why these issues went unnoticed. Additionally, our current logging infrastructure does not provide sufficient information to easily identify the impacted funds and clients, further complicating the situation.

To address this matter promptly, we are actively collaborating with our delivery teams to implement the following actions:

1. Enhancing Logging: We are working on enhancing our logging mechanisms to provide more comprehensive and real-time insights into the functioning of the Alternate Share Class Service. This will enable us to quickly identify and respond to any similar issues in the future.

2. Fixing the Issue: Our technical teams are prioritizing the resolution of the caching problem on the affected nodes to ensure uninterrupted service and fund conversions.

We understand the critical nature of this service and the impact it has on our operations and client satisfaction. Rest assured, we are committed to resolving this issue promptly and preventing its recurrence.

We will keep you updated on our progress and will inform you as soon as the issue is fully resolved. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns or would like more detailed information on the incident, please do not hesitate to reach out to me or our dedicated support team.

We apologize for any inconvenience this issue may have caused and appreciate your understanding and cooperation as we work to resolve it.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
