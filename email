Subject: Urgent: Origo Integration Issues

Hi Martin,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to update you on the ongoing issues we are experiencing with our Origo integration. There are two key points I'd like to bring to your attention:

1. **Fetch Case Error:**
   We have provided Origo with the necessary examples to counter their analysis of the issue we've been facing. However, despite our efforts, we have not received any proper analysis or resolution from their team. We are currently exploring the feasibility of implementing an internal fix to address this problem.

2. **Add Note Error:**
   Origo has confirmed that the errors we've been encountering in this case are due to validation rules they have in place on their end. Unfortunately, they have not provided us with an estimated time for resolution. In response to this, our team has already implemented some internal fixes to mitigate these errors and ensure smoother operations.

We understand the critical nature of this integration, and we are doing everything in our power to resolve these issues promptly. We will keep you updated on any developments and progress in this matter.

Please let us know if you have any questions or if there is anything else you would like us to prioritize regarding this integration. Your input is invaluable in helping us address these challenges effectively.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Best regards,
