Subject: Request to Review Internal Implementation - Origo API

Hi Martin,

I hope this email finds you well. As we discussed, I would like to propose that we revisit our internal implementation in response to the feedback from Origo.

Currently, we are encountering issues with retrieving notes from Origo due to their 40-day archival policy. While we have provided Origo with some examples to address their concerns, it's essential for us to explore alternative solutions.

Origo has suggested the feasibility of retrieving only the latest "note" from their system. This approach aligns with Camunda team's confirmation during our previous meeting, indicating that they exclusively use the latest "note" from the API response.

I believe this adjustment could help us address the challenges we've been facing and improve the efficiency of our data retrieval process. Therefore, I recommend that we take some time to assess this approach's feasibility and its potential impact on our overall implementation.

Please let me know your thoughts on this proposal and if you can allocate some time for us to discuss it further. Your insights and expertise in this matter are highly valued, and I look forward to your feedback.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
