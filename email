Subject: Urgent: Request to Increase API Gateway Response Size Limit

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I trust this email finds you well. I am writing to address a recurring issue related to the Incident (INC) we previously worked on, concerning the API Gateway response size limit. Despite our previous efforts to resolve this matter, we have encountered a similar problem once again.

In this new case, our client is managing approximately 160 funds, and the response received from the Vendor API is approximately 4.07 MB. Unfortunately, our API Gateway has a response size limit of only 2.5 MB, causing the process to fail. This situation is putting a significant strain on our Operations team as they are required to handle these cases manually due to our system's inability to support this scenario.

While we understand that the API Gateway response size limit is standardized across the organization, we also recognize that certain exceptions may be necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of critical processes. With that in mind, I kindly request that you escalate this matter to the API Gateway team for urgent review. If feasible, we would greatly appreciate an increase in the response size limit to accommodate cases like the one mentioned above.

Furthermore, to streamline our processes and prevent similar issues in the future, could you also provide us with the standard size of a client account that our current system can effectively support? This information would be invaluable for both our team and our clients, allowing us to set appropriate expectations and manage resources efficiently.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. We understand that your time is valuable, and we appreciate your effort in helping us ensure the continued success of our operations. Please feel free to reach out to me if you require any additional information or if there are any updates on this matter.

Looking forward to your prompt response.
