Subject: Urgent: Issue with Origo API Response

Hi John,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to bring to your attention an issue we've been encountering with the Origo API response.

Seems like you haven't reviewed the case we shared over your response.

As you may recall, prior to August 20th, when we attempted to retrieve multiple message IDs in a single request, the Origo API responded by providing the available notes but sent a false status for archived notes. However, it appears that there has been a recent change in the API behavior.

Now, when we make the same request, the API is rejecting the entire request instead of providing a partial response as it did before. This unexpected behavior is causing disruptions in our workflow and impacting our ability to retrieve the necessary information efficiently.

We would greatly appreciate it if you could look into this matter at your earliest convenience. Understanding the cause of this change in API behavior and finding a resolution or workaround is crucial for us to continue operating smoothly.

If you need any additional information or logs to assist with troubleshooting this issue, please let us know, and we will provide them promptly.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and we look forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
