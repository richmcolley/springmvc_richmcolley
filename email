Subject: Request for Approval: Running Conversion Eligibility Script Outside Business Hours

Hi Martin,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the ongoing efforts regarding the recon for conversion issues under PRB.

As we delve into identifying the conversion eligibility of funds, we've encountered a challenge due to the diverse conditions involved in the combination of UAN and Asset Configuration. Unfortunately, retrieving these details in bulk is not currently supported on the "ASC portal."

To address this, we have developed a custom script that utilizes the UAN and Asset information to call the "ASC" API retrieve operation. Subsequently, the script mimics the ASC Portal validations to determine conversion eligibility.

Given that this script is a custom solution, it needs to be executed through our local machines. Additionally, as we are required to retrieve data dating back to February 2020, we anticipate dealing with approximately 30,000 unique combinations of UAN and Asset. To manage this efficiently, we plan to retrieve the data in multiple chunks.

To minimize any potential impact on our regular business operations, we propose running this script during non-business hours. This approach will allow us to complete the data retrieval process without disrupting ongoing activities.

I kindly request your approval to proceed with running the script outside of business hours. Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
