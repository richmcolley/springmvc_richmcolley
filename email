Subject: Origo API Issue Updates and Resolutions

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to provide you with some important updates regarding the recent issues we've encountered with the Origo API, as well as the steps we're taking to address them.

**1. Fetch Case Error:** As you are aware, the archival policy at Origo has been in place for some time. However, the situation has evolved since their maintenance release on August 20th. According to Origo, the errors we are experiencing are a result of our attempts to retrieve older notes. While this is true to some extent, we have identified multiple scenarios where cases were functioning correctly prior to this date. We have communicated these scenarios to Origo and are actively working together to find a resolution.

**2. Add Note Error:** Origo has acknowledged that on August 20th, they implemented additional validation measures to identify duplicate messages on their end. This implementation is the root cause of the errors we've been encountering when attempting to add notes. We have raised this concern with Origo, stressing the importance of addressing this issue promptly to minimize disruptions. They are actively working on a solution, and we expect this matter to be resolved soon.

We understand the critical nature of these issues and their impact on our operations. Rest assured that our team is fully committed to collaborating with Origo to find solutions and restore the smooth functionality of our systems.

If you have any further questions or insights regarding these issues, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us navigate and resolve these challenges effectively.

We appreciate your patience and understanding during this time and will keep you updated on any developments. Thank you for your continued support.
