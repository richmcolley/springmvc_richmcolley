Subject: Request for Flexible Working Arrangement

Hi Martin,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to discuss the dynamic working arrangement we have in the team.

Unfortunately, I am writing to inform you with great sorrow that I lost my father in an accident last month. Currently, I am in my hometown, supporting my mother during this difficult time. Additionally, I am a parent to a 3-year-old, and I need to initiate her schooling sessions.

Given these circumstances, it is not feasible for me to adhere to the two days a week working from the office at the moment. I kindly request your understanding and consideration in this matter. I propose a compromise where I could commit to working two days a week from the office on alternate weeks, allowing me to balance my personal responsibilities effectively.

I understand the importance of our team's collaborative efforts, and I am committed to maintaining my productivity and contributing to our projects. I believe this adjusted schedule will enable me to fulfill both my personal and professional responsibilities.

I appreciate your understanding during this challenging time, and I am open to discussing this further to find a solution that works for both the team and me.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
