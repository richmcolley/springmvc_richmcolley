As part of our support team's responsibilities, we have the capability to share data from the "test1 DB" to fulfill reporting needs. However, I'd like to address the challenge we're facing when it comes to scheduling a dedicated report. Unfortunately, our team lacks access to a production server for report scheduling purposes.

The specific report we're discussing here necessitates data from the "test1 DB," which is synchronized with the XYZ data source on a daily basis. In light of this, I would like to offer a suggestion, rather than a formal request. Considering that the XYZ team possesses dedicated reporting servers, it might be beneficial to explore the possibility of scheduling the required report through their resources.

Collaborating with the XYZ team for scheduling this report seems logical, as it aligns well with their capacity and capabilities. This arrangement could help streamline the reporting process and ensure the timely delivery of the report's insights.



The specific requirement involves sharing data from the "test1 DB." While we are able to provide data from this source, scheduling a dedicated report has proven to be a challenge due to the absence of a production server on our end for report scheduling. However, I have identified a potential solution that could streamline this process and enhance efficiency.
Given that this report necessitates data from the "test1 DB" and relies on the daily synchronization of data from the XYZ data source, I would like to suggest that the responsibility of scheduling such a report be transferred to the XYZ team. This team possesses dedicated reporting servers and infrastructure that can support the regular generation of these reports.
