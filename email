Over the past year, I successfully led two major Java + AWS projects, diving deep into cloud infrastructure and microservices. To stay on top of the latest AWS technologies, I dedicated time to learning and applying new skills, which helped us deliver both projects seamlessly without any production issues. Additionally, I worked closely with my team to enhance our problem-solving abilities. I got hands-on experience in our BizTalk projects, tackling changes and bug fixes directly, which has been invaluable for my growth and that of the team.

I believe in leading by example when it comes to accountability. While working on the Java + AWS projects, I made it a priority to take ownership of both our successes and our setbacks. If challenges arose, I jumped in quickly to find solutions, ensuring our team learned and grew from each experience. For example, in a recent Residual automation project, we introduced automated validations that significantly reduced transaction failures, enhancing the customer experience. In a BizTalk Pure Stock transfer project, I led the implementation of an error-handling mechanism, which minimized manual interventions and improved processing accuracy, ultimately boosting our straight-through processing (STP) rates.

I have actively sought out technology solutions that not only drive agility but are also cost-effective. For instance, in the Residual and Account regex project, I led the shift to a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda. This move drastically cut our infrastructure costs since we only pay for what we use, eliminating unnecessary expenses from idle resources. It also eased the workload on our operations and production support teams, allowing them to focus on more strategic tasks.
