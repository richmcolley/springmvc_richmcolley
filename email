Subject: Regarding IR Tool and Its Maintenance

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to provide some clarity regarding the IR (Issue Resolution) Tool, its purpose, and its maintenance going forward.

The IR Tool was developed as a self-service solution catering to a specific group of users and was not intended for production use. It was built to facilitate certain functionalities and workflows related to issue resolution. As this tool is not designated as a production application, it is important to note that the broader business operations should not rely on it as a critical dependency.

Furthermore, I'd like to highlight that the IR Tool is currently situated on a decommissioning path due to its foundation on the instruction DB. This decision was made to streamline our technology landscape and allocate resources efficiently.

Given the circumstances, it's essential that we refrain from making any modifications or enhancements directly to the IR Tool. If there are any requirements for changes or improvements to the tool, these should be addressed by the delivery team responsible for managing such matters.

I understand that you have already discussed this matter with Martin. To ensure a smooth transition and appropriate handling, I kindly request your support in aligning any necessary actions with the delivery team. They will be better equipped to evaluate the feasibility and implications of any changes to the IR Tool.

Thank you for your cooperation and understanding in this matter. Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or require additional information.

Best regards,
