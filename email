During the development of the new payment module, I consistently ensured transparency with stakeholders regarding project delays caused by unforeseen technical challenges. I kept the team and management updated and proposed realistic solutions to avoid false expectations, ensuring that our commitments were always grounded in reality.

I led the team through a significant architecture migration, and during the process, I earned the trust of both the technical team and upper management by providing clear technical leadership and regularly communicating project progress. My transparency and consistent delivery built a strong foundation of trust, which resulted in successful project completion.
