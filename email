Specifically, we've observed that the Asset service is returning a 200 response with the status "Fi_I_N_F" for certain funds. While our BPM system has a robust exception handling mechanism in place, we want to highlight that this behavior is intentional and aligns with the desired response when a fund is off the platform.

Given that this is considered an expected outcome, we find it inappropriate to restrict or modify our BPM system's exception handling for this scenario. Instead, we believe that the root cause of this behavior lies within the Asset service.



During the retrieval of alternate asset details to identify the PRE conversion of an asset, we encountered an unexpected issue. Specifically, when attempting API calls to M* to retrieve off-platform asset details, an error was received from M*.

This error is not an expected behavior, and the BPM system has been designed to handle such exceptions by suspending the instance. Upon further investigation, it appears that the issue may lie either within the Asset Service or with M*.
