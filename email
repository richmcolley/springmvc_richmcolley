Subject: Asset Head Fund Cache Issue and Resolution

Dear [Recipient],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you about an issue we recently encountered with the Asset Head fund Cache, affecting the AlternateShareClass API in the ReReg Journey. Below are the details:

**Issue:**
- The problem arises during the creation of the cache by a cron job.
- The cache generation breaks, resulting in an incomplete cache.
- Certain funds that should be part of the cache are missing.

**Consequence:**
- When the system attempts to identify the Alternate Share class asset for conversion, it fails to display the fund.
- As a result, the system does not convert the asset.

**Resolution:**
- A tactical fix was implemented on 8th Nov, which yielded promising results with no reported failures. Manual validation has also been carried out.
- Ongoing discussions with product owners for a strategic fix are in progress.

**Impact:**
- The issue has affected both PRE and POST conversions in the ReReg Journey.
  - *PRE Conversions:* For cases where we don't suggest the alternate share class fund to OPM, and we do not support the fund the client holds with OPM, we ask OPM to ENCASH/EXCLUDE that fund.
  - *POST Conversions:* In instances where the AlternateShareClass API doesn't return any cheaper share class fund due to the cache issue, we are not converting client assets. This constitutes a regulatory breach in not converting assets into a cheaper share class.

We are actively working to address this issue comprehensively, and we appreciate your understanding. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out.
