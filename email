Subject: Urgent: Submission of Failed SW Cases

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. Today, our team received multiple SW (Swift) cases from TP (Third Party), and unfortunately, we encountered several issues during processing. Some of these cases failed due to users submitting multiple transactions on the same account simultaneously, while others were rejected as duplicates in the TTBU system.

To address this, I have attached a list of the failed cases for your reference. Kindly review the details and, if necessary, resubmit the pending cases to ensure a smooth processing flow.

Please be reminded to avoid submitting multiple transactions on the same account at the same time, as this has proven to be a source of errors in our systems. Your cooperation in adhering to this protocol is crucial for maintaining the efficiency and accuracy of our processes.

If you have any questions or require further clarification, feel free to reach out to me or the concerned team member.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,
