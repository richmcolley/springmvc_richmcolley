Subject: Request for Confirmation of Year-End Appraisal Adjustment

Hi Martin,

I trust this email finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss a matter related to the offer letter I received for the position of XYZ.

As per the initial offer, the compensation terms were specified to be applicable from January 25, 2024. However, there has been a recent adjustment to my compensation as part of the year-end appraisal, which is now effective from January 1, 2024.

I kindly request your assistance in reviewing and updating the offer details to reflect this recent change. It is important for me to ensure that my year-end appraisal adjustments are seamlessly integrated into the new role's compensation structure.

Could you please confirm whether my year-end appraisal changes will be considered and aligned with the terms of the offer for the position of XYZ? Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your understanding and assistance.

Best regards,
