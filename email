Subject: Origo API Issue Identification and Updates

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to provide an update on the recent issues we've identified with the Origo API while working closely with Martin. While our initial communication highlighted one issue, it has come to our attention that there are actually two distinct problems affecting our system's interaction with the Origo API.

1. **Fetch Case Error:** Origo has informed us that they have a 40-day archival policy in place, which means we cannot retrieve messages or data beyond this timeframe. Our system has been designed to retrieve all transfer notes from Origo, even if some of these notes are quite old. However, Origo has now indicated that if any of the requested notes have been archived, it results in a failure of the entire request.

   Upon further investigation of our logs, we discovered that this behavior was not present prior to August 20th. We have already shared these logs with the Origo team to help them understand the issue better.

2. **Add Note Error:** Another issue we've encountered is related to adding notes to Origo. When a user attempts to update a chaser note on Origo, it fails with a duplicate message error if the same note already exists in Origo's system.

   Origo has responded to this issue by suggesting that our system is sending duplicate notes, which is causing the failure. In our analysis of historical logs, we found that such errors were not occurring before August 20th. We have also shared these logs with Origo to assist in their investigation.

We understand the importance of resolving these issues promptly to ensure the smooth operation of our systems. Our team is actively working with Origo to address these problems, and we are committed to finding a solution as quickly as possible.

If you have any additional insights or questions regarding these issues, please feel free to reach out to us. We greatly appreciate your cooperation and understanding as we work to resolve these matters.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and we will keep you updated on any developments.
