Subject: Assistance Required: AlternateShareClass Portal Logic Evaluation

Hi Martin,

I hope this email finds you well. We are currently in the process of reevaluating the logic behind our AlternateShareClass Portal, specifically focusing on the identification of asset conversions based on certain conditions.

As you know, the functionality of this portal relies heavily on the ASC API. We would greatly appreciate your assistance in understanding and clarifying certain aspects of the API's implementation. Here are the specific queries we have:

1. **commonShareClass Flag:**
   - Could you please provide insights into how the API sets the value of the "commonShareClass" flag? Understanding the logic behind this flag is crucial for our reevaluation.

2. **dealingAllowed Flag and Alternate Asset:**
   - We are particularly interested in scenarios where the "dealingAllowed" flag is set to "NO" for an alternate asset. Does the API return information about this alternate asset in the response? Understanding the behavior in such cases is essential for our analysis.

Your expertise in these matters would significantly contribute to our ongoing efforts. If possible, could we schedule a brief meeting to discuss these queries in more detail? Your availability for a discussion at your earliest convenience would be highly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your support, and we look forward to resolving these queries with your assistance.

Best regards,
