We have identified a recurring problem with the BizTalk system, specifically related to zombie messages. These messages are causing failures in the dealing notification process, leading to subsequent settlement failures in the WBS system. The root cause of this issue has been identified as a product design flaw, as confirmed by our delivery team. As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance system reliability, the issue will be addressed through the upcoming reimagine program.

In recent cases, the dealing notification has failed on the trade day itself. Unfortunately, by the time our support team identifies and manually reprocesses the failed notification, the settlement process in the WBS system has already progressed, resulting in failed settlements due to the lack of corresponding trades in the Sonata system.



As of now, the Altus system has been transitioned into a closed state. In this closed state, any work item (WI) that enters the system is automatically met with a "Not Exists" error response. I understand that this error message might appear misleading, but I want to clarify that this configuration has been intentionally set up in this way.

The purpose of implementing this error response is to streamline the workflow and prevent any unintended processing of work items while the Altus system remains in a closed state. While the error message itself might seem puzzling, rest assured that it serves the function of informing users that the system is not currently available for processing new work items.


The system will only place deals for Altus exception cases.
Altus fund updates subsequent to these exception cases must be performed by Ops users.
Duplicate deal placement will not occur unless a valid REFERENCE exists in the Altus system.


I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to extend my appreciation for your meticulous work in segregating the recent issues. Your effort in breaking down the problems has provided us with a clearer understanding of the situation. I'd like to highlight and discuss some of the key points you've raised:

1. **PRB001 BizTalk Zombie Message Issue:**
This issue pertains to a product design flaw, and I've confirmed with the delivery team that it will be addressed as part of the reimagine program. The problem arises when dealing notifications fail on the trade day, leading to settlement issues. Although the support team currently handles such cases manually, there's an inherent risk due to the need for manual intervention. It's important to note that even though support teams monitor and reprocess these cases, instances like the one with dealing date 27th June and settlement date 28th June highlight potential vulnerabilities.

2. **Altus Closed State and "Not Exists" Error:**
When Altus is in a closed state, any incoming work item will trigger a "not exists" error. While this error might seem misleading, it's actually configured this way for specific reasons.

3. **Altus Exception Cases and Fund Update:**
For Altus exception cases, the system initiates deal placement, and subsequent Altus fund updates should be managed by Ops users. The system is designed not to duplicate deals unless a valid reference exists in Altus.

4. **Reopening a Previously Closed Issue:**
Regarding the issue addressed earlier, which was closed due to insufficient logs, we've encountered a similar instance. To properly investigate and determine a conclusion, we need to reopen this case and seek assistance from the delivery team. The lack of sufficient logs necessitates their expertise.

5. **Response to INCs and Investigation Focus:**
Danis, you mentioned that the INCs I pointed out were resolved in the initial phase of the project. Kindly provide new cases that require investigation. This will help us concentrate on identifying and resolving fresh issues.

In conclusion, point 3 concerning Altus remains unresolved. However, it's worth noting that all other cases are either already closed, or the BPM process manages the Altus closure.
