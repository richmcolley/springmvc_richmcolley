Hi martin
this is regarding the recon we are doing for conversion issue under PRB.
to identify a fund is conversion eligible or not is depends on various conditions in a combination of UAN and Asset Configuration. And to retrieve such details in bulk is not available on "ASC portal".
To cater this we have written a script which takes UAN and Asset and calls "ASC" API retrieve operation and then mimics the ASC Portal validations.
now since this is a custom script, we need to run it via our local machine. Also we need to retrieve data since Feb 2020 so there are approx 30K unique combinations of UAN and Asset. And we need to retrieve this in multiple chunks.
