During the development of the new payment module, I consistently ensured transparency with stakeholders regarding project delays caused by unforeseen technical challenges. I kept the team and management updated and proposed realistic solutions to avoid false expectations, ensuring that our commitments were always grounded in reality.

I led the team through a significant architecture migration, and during the process, I earned the trust of both the technical team and upper management by providing clear technical leadership and regularly communicating project progress. My transparency and consistent delivery built a strong foundation of trust, which resulted in successful project completion.




consistently displayed excellent leadership by guiding the testing team through complex challenges, attention to detail ensured that even the smallest defects were identified and addressed early in the development process. 
Another qualities is her ability to communicate clearly without being biased which ensured a smooth flow of information between teams.


He has demonstrated exceptional diligence in testing various backend services, APIs, and data flows of ReReg and Transfers. They ensured that all critical scenarios, including edge cases, were covered, which led to the identification and resolution of several key issues early on.
His understanding of the process allowed him to target the potential areas of failure. This understanding also enabled him to provide valuable feedback to the development team.
He is proactive in collaborating with developers, ensuring that any issues found should communicated and resolved efficiently. His willingness to work closely with the team aid a collaborative environment that improved overall workflow.


Although I haven’t worked on an end-to-end project with him, I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with them on resolving production incidents (INCs) and addressing non-production code issues. In these scenarios, he has consistently demonstrated strong technical skills, a problem-solving mindset, and a collaborative approach.
He has been efficient in diagnosing and resolving production incidents, under tight deadlines. His ability to troubleshoot issues quickly and accurately has helped minimize downtime and restore system functionality promptly.
Even in the limited interactions we’ve had, it’s clear that he has a deep understanding of Java, particularly in addressing issues related to performance, bug fixes, and code optimizations.



He brings deep technical expertise to the table, particularly when it comes to diagnosing and fixing complex issues in both production and non-production environments. His knowledge of Java, backend systems, and architecture enables him to quickly identify the root cause and implement effective solutions.
From day one, he has been incredibly supportive, taking the time to guide me through both technical and product-related challenges. His willingness to explain key concepts, processes, and architectural decisions has significantly helped me get up to speed and feel confident in my contributions.
